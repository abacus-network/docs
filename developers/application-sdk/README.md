# Application SDK

The Abacus Application SDK help developers manage multichain Abacus applications. This requires a higher level API than dApp developers are familiar with which is namespaced by target network. It is composed of 2 main packages: tooling for multichain deployments and an interaction API.

### [Deployment Tooling](deployment-tooling.md)

The `@abacus-network/deploy` package facilitates configuration and deployment of Abacus applications. This includes utilities for bytecode verification, working with various proxy contracts patterns, and sanity checking deployments for consistency across chains.

### [Interaction API](interaction-api.md)

The `AbacusApp` abstraction exported in the `@abacus-network/sdk` package manages collections of contract interfaces on each network. This can be extended and instantiated with artifacts generated by the deployment tooling.

#### [MultiProvider](multiprovider.md)

The `MultiProvider` exported in the `@abacus-network/sdk` package abstracts away node interaction for supported Abacus networks. This includes utilities for transaction signing and estimating the gas costs of processing dispatched messages to remote chains.&#x20;
