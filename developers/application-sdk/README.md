# Application SDK

The Abacus Application SDK helps developers create and manage applications built on top of interchain smart contracts. This introduces an API which is structured for connecting to several chains at once. It is composed of two main packages: tooling for multichain deployments and APIs for contract interaction.

### [Deployment Tooling](deployment-tooling.md)

The @abacus-network/deploy package facilitates configuration and deployment of interchain smart contracts. This includes utilities for bytecode verification, contract upgradability patterns, and sanity checking deployments for consistency across chains.

### [Contract Interactions](contract-interaction.md)

The classes in the `@abacus-network/sdk` package help you manage and interact with contracts  on different networks. The `AbacusApp` class manages the contract collections. It can be extended and instantiated with artifacts generated by the deployment tooling.
