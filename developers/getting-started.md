# Getting started

Abacus makes interchain communication straightforward by providing a simple API for sending and receiving interchain messages.

_**Integrating with Abacus?**_ Use the [contract SDK](contract-sdk/) to write and test your contracts.

_**Building an interchain application?**_ The [application SDK](application-sdk/) has everything else you need.

_**Looking for an example?**_ The [template repo](https://github.com/abacus-network/abacus-app-template) has a "Hello World" Abacus application.

_**Looking for a step-by-step tutorial?**_** ** Keep reading for a step-by-step walkthrough of how to build your first interchain application using Abacus.

_**Not sure what to build?**_ Take a look at some [example applications](examples/) to see what you can do.
