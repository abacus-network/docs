# ERC20 token

You can see an example interchain ERC20 token in the [abacus-token repo](https://github.com/abacus-network/abacus-token).

As you can see, the additional changes on top of the vanilla OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract are minimal. It has a `transferRemote()` function that burns the specified amount of tokens on the sending chain and mints the equivalent amount on the receiving chain.
